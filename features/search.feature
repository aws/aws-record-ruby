Feature: Amazon DynamoDB Querying and Scanning
  This feature tests integration of the client #query and #scan methods with the
  Aws::Record abstraction.  To run these tests, you will need to have valid AWS
  credentials that are accessible with the AWS SDK for Ruby's standard
  credential provider chain. In practice, this means a shared credential file or
  environment variables with your credentials. These tests may have some AWS
  costs associated with running them since AWS resources are created and
  destroyed within these tests.

  Background:
    Given a DynamoDB table named 'example' with data:
      """
      [
        { "attribute_name": "id", "attribute_type": "S", "key_type": "HASH" },
        { "attribute_name": "count", "attribute_type": "N", "key_type": "RANGE" }
      ]
      """
